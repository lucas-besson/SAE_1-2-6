            "\n\t1.\t\tThe game starts with an empty board. Each player has nine pieces, distinguished by color, such as red and black.\n" +
            "\t2.\t\tPlayers take turns placing their pieces on the intersections of the lines. The goal is to form \"mills\", which are vertical or horizontal lines of three pieces of the same color. When a mill is formed, the player who created it can remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board (by clicking on it).\n" +
            "\t3.\t\tAfter all the pieces have been placed on the board, players take turns moving their pieces along the lines to adjacent empty intersections (by clicking on the pawn and the wanted destination). The pieces can move in any direction along the lines, but they cannot jump over other pieces.\n" +
            "\t4.\t\tWhen a player's move creates a mill (three pieces in a row), they can remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board.\n" +
            "\t5.\t\tThe game continues until one player has only two pieces left or is unable to make a legal move. In the latter case, the other player wins.\n" +
            "\t6.\t\tThe game ends when one player captures enough of their opponent's pieces to reduce them to two, or when a player is unable to make a legal move.\n" +
            "\nStrategic thinking in Nine Men's Morris revolves around creating mills while simultaneously blocking your opponent's moves and preventing them from forming mills. The ability to anticipate and disrupt your opponent's plans is crucial for success in this game.\n" +
